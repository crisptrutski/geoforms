# geoforms
Reagent app for local democracy tools

## Usage

### Development mode

To run the Figwheel development server, run:

```
lein do clean, run
```

The application will now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To start the Figwheel compiler, run the following command in a separate terminal:

```
lein figwheel
```
Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

If you're only doing client-side development then it's sufficient to simply run the
Figwheel compiler and then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449)
once it starts up.

#### Optional development tools

Start the browser REPL:

```
$ lein repl
```
The Jetty server can be started by running:

```clojure
(start-server)
```
and stopped by running:
```clojure
(stop-server)
```

### Building for release

```
lein cljsbuild clean
lein uberjar
```
